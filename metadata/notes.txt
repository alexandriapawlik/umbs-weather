PLAN

1. In Excel:
- move notes from excel margins to notes column
- move data from notes field to data fields
	- both CSV and excel

2. In R:
- import data
- remove extra rows and columns
- fix date and time data
- glimpse variable names and aggregate tables
- quality assurance:
	- remove white space
	- make sure all missing values are NA
	- check for characters in number columns
		- change T to 0, specify in metadata that 0=trace
	- make cloud types consistent and replace with full types
		- check for invalid cloud types and replace with NA
	- add flag column for bounds checking
		- standardize flags across datasets
	- check number precision based on metadata
- export as CSV
