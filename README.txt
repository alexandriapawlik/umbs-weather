In this folder you will find data tables containing weather observations from the University of Michigan Biological Station. These data tables span two resident biologist (Robert Vande Kopple - BVK, and Adam Schbel) and 40 plus years of observation. 

Goals
0. Review data tables and decide upon a single table structure, variable names, and data types (character or numeric for temperature for example)
1. Rename column headers (variable names) in all tables and format column data types.
2. Merge tables into one master table
3. QA/QC observations (are values within expected range?, are values the correct type (temp column has text saying why the measurement is not correct), etc.)
4. Collect metadata from A. Schubel, J. Tallant, and BVK
5. Run through EML assembly line
6. Publish to EDI
